# Final_Project-Engineering-
My final project of industrial engineering is a study about different data mining and machine learning techniques, 
like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and SVM with linear kernel. 
In this project, I try to predict if the students of my career (Indudrial Engineering) will pass or not 
the first 6 subjects of the second year.  
I use as a predictor features: the marks obtained the first year, the attemps needed to pass every first year subject 
and the access note to the career.
